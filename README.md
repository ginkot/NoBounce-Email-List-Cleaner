[About]

Email list validation & cleaning maximizes the efficiency of your email marketing campaigns and protects your email sender reputation.

It's important to realize that when email marketing, it's good to maintain a good clean list of leads. Without a clean list, you may soon find your campaigns skip the target inbox and instead become flagged as spam by many mail servers. Whether using third party marketing tools such as MailChimp or your own email server, it's paramount that a clean list is used to protect your reputation and ensure your messages reach your target audience.

NoBounce Email List Cleaner features many resources to minimize email server blacklisting by removing emails based on large suppression lists of low quality and no-value emails, such as: Spam Traps, Role-Based Emails, Emails with Profanity, Government Emails, Complainers, Litigators and more. You can also customize the software to incorporate your own suppression lists and then begin to build a database of good quality leads.

The software features an easy drag and drop and fully responsive interface! Thousands of files can simply be dropped onto the software interface and the software will quietly process millions of leads according to your selected filters. Real-time feedback is provided and optional email reporting at email-level is fully supported!

Do you have a complex spreadsheet file with an email column and want to maintain your existing data? No problem! NoBounce Email List Cleaner keeps complete track of existing data during the whole process and can optionally provide email feedback alongside your existing data! No other email cleaner on the market features this unique ability!

NoBounce Email List Cleaner has been rigorously tested by our dedicated team. During our performance benchmarks, NoBounce Email List Cleaner outperforms the competition by up to 200%! Also offering more accurate results! (Based on a sample of 500 files, each containing 1 million leads)

During the entire process, we never send any email to the recipient address. All mail servers are verified through external utilities, protecting your privacy and maintaining your anonymity.
